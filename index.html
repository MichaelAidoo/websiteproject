                     McDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches,
                     French fries, soft drinks, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets,
                     McDonald's offers salads and vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare.
                     On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the McRib sandwich.
                     Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal.
                     [31] During March of each year, McDonald's offers a Shamrock Shake to honor Saint Patrick's Day.[32]
                     In addition, the chain also sells some items within the United States on a regional basis; for example, 
                     the Hatch Green Chile Double Cheeseburger, which is topped with New Mexico green chile, 
                     is only available in the southwestern state of New Mexico.[33][34]
                     Products are offered as either "dine-in" (where the customer opts to eat in the restaurant) or "take-out" (where the customer opts to take the food off the premises). 
                     "Dine-in" meals are provided on a plastic tray with a paper insert on the floor of the tray. 
                     "Take-out" meals are usually delivered with the contents enclosed in a distinctive McDonald's-branded brown paper bag. 
                     In both cases, the individual items are wrapped or boxed as appropriate.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Kempczinski">click here for more</a>

                        Damodharan K., professionally known as Chef Damu,[1] is an Indian celebrity chef. 
                        He has hosted numerous cooking shows and reality cooking competitions on various Tamil language television channels, 
                        most notably a s a judge on Cooku with Comali on Star Vijay. 
                        In 2010, he received a Guinness World Record for the longest cooking marathon by a single individual.[2] 
                        He also became the first Indian chef to receive Ph.D in Hotel Management and Catering Technology, 
                        which was awarded by the University of Madras in 2004.[3] Furthermore, he has made a few appearances in Tamil films.A chef is a professional cook and tradesman who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation, often focusing on a particular cuisine. The word "chef" is derived from the term chef de cuisine (French pronunciation: ​[ʃɛf də kɥizin]), the director or head of a kitchen. Chefs can receive formal training from an institution, as well as by apprenticing with an experienced chef.

                        There are different terms that use the word chef in their titles, and deal with specific areas of food preparation. Examples include the sous-chef, who acts as the second-in-command in a kitchen, and the chef de partie, who handles a specific area of production. The kitchen brigade system is a hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels employing extensive staff, many of which use the word "chef" in their titles. Underneath the chefs are the kitchen assistants. A chef's standard uniform includes a hat (called a toque), neckerchief, double-breasted jacket, apron and sturdy shoes (that may include steel or plastic toe-caps).
                        
                        Etymology
                        The word "chef" is derived (and shortened) from the term chef de cuisine (French pronunciation: ​[ʃɛf.də.kɥi.zin]), the director or head of a kitchen. (The French word comes from Latin caput (head) and is cognate with English "chief"). In English, the title "chef" in the culinary profession originated in the haute cuisine of the 19th century. The culinary arts, among other aspects of the French language, introduced French loan words into the English language.[1] The word is often used by itself as an honorific to address a chef by each other, apprentices, and waiting staff.
