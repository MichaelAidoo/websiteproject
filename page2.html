                  <h2>Accra (Capital)</h2>
                  <p>
                     Accra is the capital and largest city of Ghana,
                     located on the southern coast at the Gulf of Guinea, 
                     which is part of the Atlantic Ocean.[2] As of 2021 census, 
                     the Accra Metropolitan District, 20.4 km2 (7.9 sq mi), 
                     had a population of 284,124 inhabitants, and the larger Greater Accra Region, 
                     3,245 km2 (1,253 sq mi), had a population of 5,455,692 inhabitants.
                     As Accra is close to the equator, the daylight hours are practically uniform during the year. 
                     Relative humidity is generally high, varying from 65% in the midafternoon to 95% at night. 
                     The predominant wind direction in Accra is from the WSW to NNE sectors. Wind speeds normally range between 8 and 16 km/h. 
                     High wind gusts occur with thunderstorms, which generally pass in squalls along the coast.

                    <h3>Ghana’s stable, democratic government supports mining</h3>
                       <p>
                        Ghana’s political stability is underpinned by strong democratic credentials. The mining industry accounts for over 50% of foreign direct investment and is the largest tax-paying sector in the country.Gold contributes over 90% of Ghana’s total mineral exports3 and makes up 49% of the country's total export value.Ghana’s prolific Bibiani Shear zone, location of Newcore’s Enchi Gold Project, hosts several multi-million ounce gold deposits. Mines are operated by some of the world’s largest gold companies including Newmont and Kinross.Ghana has an advanced infrastructure platform compared with most African countries, including water, electricity and mobile networks as well as a good network of roads and highways. The country’s long history of mining has provided a skilled and well-educated mining workforce.
